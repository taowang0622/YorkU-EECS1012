<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am applying for the position of Software Engineer Intern. I got a bachelor's degree in physics before, and right now I am studying at York University for my second bachelor's degree in computer science.
    I am looking for a 4-month internship for my last coop work term, and I see this position as a perfect opportunity for me to learn and contribute.
</p>

<p>I am enthusiastic and self-motivated. I enroll in online courses on Coursera, Stanford Online and other MOOC websites to keep up with new technologies and update my knowledge, in the meantime remaining in a good academic standing. So far I have finished 14 online courses. I consider
    myself as project-oriented. I believe the best way to learn is through practice experience and hard work, so I work on personal projects, mostly web projects, to polish my programming skills and internalize knowledge. I love teamwork and being immersed in fast-paced agile environments.
    I joined Hackfest 2017 and 2018 at York University, RBC SummerHack 2018 where I pitched ideas, made demos and gave presentations together with other team members, and I am lucky to be able to work with different teams on different projects during the current and past internships. I have a good understanding of data structure
    and algorithm. With the help of the physics background, I can understand them well and quickly adapt them to solve various complex problems.
</p>

<p>
    I am an expert at backend development with J2EE and Spring, adept at the JavaScript full stack development using AngularJS, Angular, React, Bootstrap, JQuery and NodeJS,
    fluent in SQL, and have experience using MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Docker, AWS and CI/CD.
</p>

<p>This winter, I am working for a multinational software company, Nuance Communications, in Montreal, on Natural Language Processing Services(NLPS) team, in the mobility division. In Fall 2018, I worked for a startup company, Nascent Digital, on mobile apps for IOS and Android. In Summer 2018 I interned in RBC Global Systems Management Department, working on a web-based distributed system that is intended for RBC employees worldwide to search and report RBC assets efficiently and conveniently.
    From June to December 2017 I worked as a teaching assistant at York University and the major duty was helping students finish their lab assignments. From March to May 2017 I interned at Lokafy, a startup aiming to connect travelers with locals, where I collaborated with other team members to redesign the website and rewrite a dashboard web application using AngularJS and Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I believe I can be a valuable asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Tao Wang</p>
