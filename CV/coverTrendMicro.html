<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am applying for the position of Java Software Developer Intern - Fall 2018. I got a bachelor's degree in physics before, and right now I am studying at York University for my second bachelor's degree in computer science.
</p>


<p>I am enthusiastic and self-motivated. I am in good academic standing with all grades to be A or A+, and at the same time I enroll in online courses on Coursera, Stanford Online and other MOOC websites to keep up with new technologies and update my knowledge. So far I have finished 14 online courses. I consider
    myself as object-oriented. I like doing projects, mostly web projects, to polish my programming skills and internalize knowledge, and I usually keep optimizing them up to higher performance. I love working in teams and challenging myself in a fast-paced environment.
    I joined Hackfest 2017 and 2018 at York University where I pitched ideas, made demos and gave presentations together with other team members in two days. I have a good understanding of data structure
    and algorithm. With the help of the physics background, I can understand them well and quickly adapt them to solve various problems.
</p>

<p>
    I am an expert at back-end development with J2EE, NodeJS and Spring Framework, good at front-end development using AngularJS, Angular and Bootstrap,
    fluent in SQL, and have experience using SQL and NoSQL databases which are MySQL, MongoDB and Redis.
</p>

<p>I am honoured to be selected to work as a developer intern in the RBC Global Systems Management Team this summer, and my duty is to help develop a web app for all RBC employees across the world
    to search data about servers, work stations, teams, offices, employees, etc. From June to December 2017 I worked as a teaching assistant at York University and the major duty was helping students finish their lab assignments. During work, I instructed them to find out solutions and bugs by themselves by
    using knowledge they learned from lectures and teaching them debugging techniques. I interned at Lokafy, a startup aiming to connect travelers with locals, from March to May 2017. During that internship,
    I collaborated with other team members to redesign the website and rewrite the front-end code mainly using AngularJS and Bootstrap to make the front-end code more maintainable and readable.</p>

<p>I believe I can be a valuable asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Tao Wang</p>
