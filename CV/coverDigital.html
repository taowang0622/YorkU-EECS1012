<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am applying for Summer Internship 2018 in Technology and Digital Banking. I have got a bachelor's degree in physics before and right now I am studying at York University for my second bachelor's degree in computer science. I attended Scotia Bank Tech Info Session at York University earlier
    ,and I am very interested in learning opportunities you can provide to interns, so I see this internship as the
    ideal opportunity for me to contribute knowledge and skills I gained from my experience and academic studies to enterprise product development.</p>


<p>I am enthusiastic and self-motivated. I am doing well academically with all grades to be A or A+, and at the same time I enroll in online courses on Coursera or other MOOC websites to keep up with new technologies and update my knowledge. By now I have finished 13 online courses. I consider
    myself as object-oriented. I like doing projects to polish my programming skills and internalize knowledge, and I usually keep optimizing and improving them up to higher performance. I like collaborating with other people.
    I joined Hackfest 2017 at York University during which we pitched ideas, brought them to life and ended up making a demo using AngularJS, Bootstrap and NodeJS. I have a good understanding of data structure
    and algorithm. With the help of the physics background, I can understand them well and quickly and adapt them to solve various problems.
</p>

<p>
    My goal is to become a full stack developer, but now I mainly focus on back-end development with JAVA. I am an expert at back-end development with J2EE and Spring, good at front-end development using AngularJS and Bootstrap,
    have experience using SQL and NoSQL databases which are MySQL, MongoDB and Redis.
</p>

<p>From June to December 2017 I worked as a teaching assistant at York University and the major duty was helping students finish their lab assignments. During work, I instructed them to find out solutions and bugs by themselves by
    using knowledge they learned from lectures and teaching them debugging techniques and how to use debugging tools. I interned at Lokafy, a startup aiming to connect travelers with locals, from March to May 2017. During that internship,
    I collaborated with other team members to redesign the website and rewrite the front-end code mainly using AngularJS and Bootstrap to make the front-end code more maintainable and readable.</p>


<p>I believe I can be a valuable asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Tao Wang</p>
