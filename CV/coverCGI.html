<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am applying for the position of Web Developer. I got a bachelor's degree in physics before, and right now I am studying at York University for my second bachelor's degree in computer science.
    I have been looking for coop/internship opportunities about Java, and I see this position as a perfect opportunity for me to learn and contribute.
</p>

<p>I am enthusiastic and self-motivated. I am in good academic standing at school, and at the same time I enroll in online courses on Coursera, Stanford Online and other MOOC websites to keep up with new technologies and update my knowledge. So far I have finished 14 online courses. I consider
    myself as object-oriented. I like doing projects, mostly web projects, to polish my programming skills and internalize knowledge, and I usually keep optimizing them up to higher performance. I love working in teams and challenging myself in a fast-paced environment.
    I joined Hackfest 2017 and 2018 at York University and RBC SummerHack 2018 for RBC summer students where I pitched ideas, made demos and gave presentations together with other team members. I have a good understanding of data structure
    and algorithm. With the help of the physics background, I can understand them well and quickly adapt them to solve various complex problems.
</p>

<p>
    My major focus and interest are on Java technology stack. I am an expert at backend development with J2EE, and Spring, good at JavaScript full stack development using AngularJS, Angular, Bootstrap and NodeJS,
    fluent in SQL, and have experience using MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Docker and AWS(EC2 and RDS).
</p>

<p>I am working for a startup company, Nascent Digital, on an AR mobile app for IOS and Android using React Native this Fall. I worked as a developer intern in the RBC Global Systems Management Department this summer, working on a web-based distributed system that is intended for RBC employees worldwide to search and report RBC assets efficiently and conveniently, and
    my current major duty is to migrate frontend application from AngularJS to Angular6 and fixed bugs on the frontend and backend reported by users. From June to December 2017 I worked as a teaching assistant at York University and the major duty was helping students finish their lab assignments. I interned at Lokafy, a startup aiming to connect travelers with locals, from March to May 2017. During that internship,
    I collaborated with other team members to redesign the website and rewrite a dashboard web application using AngularJS and Bootstrap to make the frontend code more maintainable and readable.</p>

<p>I believe I can be a valuable asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Tao Wang</p>
