<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am applying for the position of 2018 Toronto Software Development Engineer Intern. I will graduate in January 2019 from York University with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science,
    and that will be my second Bachelor degree, because I have got a Bachelor degree in Physics when I was in China. I am looking for a summer internship in 2018 and see this position as the
ideal opportunity for me to contribute knowledge and skills I gained form my professional experience and academic studies to enterprise product development.</p>


<p>I am enthusiastic and self-motivated. Asides from taking courses at university, I also enroll in other online courses on Coursera to keep up with new technologies and update my knowledge. I consider
    myself as object-oriented. I like doing projects to polish my programming skills and internalize knowledge, and continue to optimize and maintain them to challenge myself to learn more. I have a good understanding of data structure
    and algorithm. Since I have the background of physics, I can understand them better and adapt them to solve various problems. In addition, I like solving algorithm problems on Leetcode to continue strengthening my problem solving skills.
</p>

<p>Currently I'm working as a teaching assistant at York University and the major duty is helping students finish their lab assignments. During work, I instruct them to find out solutions and bugs by themselves by
using knowledge they learn from the lectures and teaching them debugging techniques and how to use debugging tools, like Chrome DevTools. I have interned at Lokafy, a startup aiming to connect travelers with locals. During that internship,
I collaborated with other team members to redesign the website and rewrote the front-end code mainly using AngularJS and Bootstrap to make the front-end code more maintainable and readable.</p>


<p>I believe I can be a valuable asset to your organization. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Tao Wang</p>
