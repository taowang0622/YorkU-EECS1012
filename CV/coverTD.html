<p>January 3, 2018</p>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am applying for the position of Developer Co-op - GTA starting May 2018. I have got a bachelor's degree in physics before and right now I am studying at York University for my second bachelor's degree in computer science. I see this position as the
    ideal opportunity for me to contribute knowledge and skills I gained from my professional experience and academic studies to enterprise product development.</p>


<p>I am enthusiastic and self-motivated. I am doing well academically with all grades to be A or A+, and at the same time I enroll in online courses on Coursera or other MOOC websites to keep up with new technologies and update my knowledge. By now I have finished 13 online courses. I consider
    myself as object-oriented. I like doing projects to polish my programming skills and internalize knowledge, and I usually keep optimizing and improving them up to higher performance. I have a good understanding of data structure
    and algorithm. With the help of the physics background, I can understand them well and quickly and adapt them to solve various problems.
</p>

<p>Currently I'm working as a teaching assistant at York University and the major duty is helping students finish their lab assignments. During work, I instruct them to find out solutions and bugs by themselves by
    using knowledge they learn from lectures and teaching them debugging techniques and how to use debugging tools, like Chrome DevTools. I have interned at Lokafy, a startup aiming to connect travelers with locals. During that internship,
    I collaborated with other team members to redesign the website and rewrite the front-end code mainly using AngularJS and Bootstrap to make the front-end code more maintainable and readable.</p>


<p>I believe I can be a valuable asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Tao Wang</p>
