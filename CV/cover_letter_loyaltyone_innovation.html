<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I am applying for the position of Innovation Developer Intern, Winter 2019. I got a bachelor's degree in physics before, and right now I am studying at York University for my second bachelor's degree in computer science.
</p>

<p>I am enthusiastic and self-motivated. I am in good academic standing at school, and at the same time I enroll in online courses on Coursera, Stanford Online and other MOOC websites to keep up with new technologies and update my knowledge. So far I have finished 14 online courses. I consider
    myself as object-oriented. I like doing projects, mostly web projects, to polish my programming skills and internalize knowledge, and I usually keep optimizing them up to higher performance. I love working in teams and challenging myself in a fast-paced environment.
    I joined Hackfest 2017 and 2018 at York University, RBC SummerHack 2018 where I pitched ideas, made demos and gave presentations together with other team members. I have a good understanding of data structure
    and algorithm. With the help of the physics background, I can understand them well and quickly adapt them to solve various complex problems.
</p>

<p>
    My major focus and interest are on Java technology stack. I am an expert at backend development with J2EE, and Spring, good at JavaScript full stack development using AngularJS, Angular, Bootstrap and NodeJS,
    fluent in SQL, and have experience using MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Docker, AWS and CI/CD.
</p>

<p>I am working for a startup company, Nascent Digital, on mobile apps for IOS and Android in agile development environment this Fall. I interned in RBC Global Systems Management Department this summer, working on a web-based distributed system that is intended for RBC employees worldwide to search and report RBC assets efficiently and conveniently.
    From June to December 2017 I worked as a teaching assistant at York University and the major duty was helping students finish their lab assignments. I interned at Lokafy, a startup aiming to connect travelers with locals, from March to May 2017 where I collaborated with other team members to redesign the website and rewrite a dashboard web application using AngularJS and Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I believe I can be a valuable asset to your company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Tao Wang</p>
