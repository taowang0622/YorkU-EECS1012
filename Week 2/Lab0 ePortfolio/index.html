    <p>This lab is about familiarizing us with web tools that will be used in the following labs. Building on software provided
     by the course, a HTML file was generated, and succeeded being rendered in firefox browser. In addiction, I explored to transfer it to my android device and
      turned out it run pretty well. While doing the lab, I recorded the processes of the application running within CentOs and android device, and then put them
    into my e-Portfolio</p>

    <p>Nowadays, web applications are practically everywhere, especially on mobile devices, like cellphone, tablet. A web application is based on a client-side/front-end and a
     server-side/back-end, and the former is what we actually see on the screen, and this lab is aimed at feeling how a file written by HTML and CSS is rendered and displayed in a browser and android device.
        On top of that, through recording the lab process, can learn how to use some media tools, like screenshot apps, and video editors, etc.

    <p>The html file has already been provided, so I opened it with atom editor to view code, then tried to tweak code to check how the preview window was going to
    change, and then opened it with firefox browser and recorded it with my android device, and took a screen shot into Dropbox. In order to let the file be rendered in my android device, first, finding my laptop IP by
    typing ipconfig command in cmd.exe, second, clicking the app called HTML2APK on my android device and typing my IP, port and path in the load section, last, sitting back and wait for
    downloading and then the web page displayed on the screen, of course, the whole process had been recorded by an app called AZ Screen Recorder. As required, the last step is to
     combine two videos, and upload it to youtube, and put the links into my e-Portfolio and structure it.</p>
